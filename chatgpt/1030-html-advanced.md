HTML5 introduced several new and advanced tags that enhance the semantic meaning and functionality of web content. Here are some of the advanced tags you should know:

### **1. `<canvas>`**
- **Purpose**: Allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.
- **Usage**: Used for drawing graphics, game animations, data visualization, etc.

  ```html
  <canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
  ```

### **2. `<svg>`**
- **Purpose**: Scalable Vector Graphics, used for defining vector-based graphics that can be scaled without losing quality.
- **Usage**: Inline drawings, icons, complex shapes.

  ```html
  <svg width="100" height="100">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
  </svg>
  ```

### **3. `<article>`**
- **Purpose**: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post, news article, or forum entry.
- **Usage**: Encapsulate an individual piece of content that could be distributed independently.

  ```

### **10. `<meter>`**
- **Purpose**: Represents a scalar measurement within a known range, or a fractional value.
- **Usage**: Display a measurement or a rating (like disk usage, fuel gauge, etc.).

  ```html

  <meter id="gauge" value="2.7" min="0" max="4">2.7 out of 4</meter>
  ```

### **11. `<details>` and `<summary>`**
- **Purpose**: `<details>` is used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close. `<summary>` is used to provide a heading for the `<details>` content.
- **Usage**: Hide and show content like FAQs.

  ```html

    <summary>Click here for more information</summary>
    <p>This is the detailed content that is hidden by default.</p>
  </details>
  ```

### **12. `<template>`**
- **Purpose**: Defines a chunk of HTML that is not rendered when the page loads but can be instantiated later using JavaScript.
- **Usage**: Client-side templating.

      <p>Item Description</p>
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

### **13. `<mark>`**

### **14. `<output>`**
- **Purpose**: Represents the result of a calculation or user action.

    = <output name="result" for="a b">100</output>

    <img src="img-small.jpg" alt="Image description">
  </picture>
  ```

These advanced HTML5 tags help in creating more semantic, interactive, and accessible web pages. They enhance both the user experience and the maintainability of the code.
